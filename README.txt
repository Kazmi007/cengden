For this assignment I chose NEXT JS as the framework of choice since it has good support for MongoDB and is a good solution when there's no need for a separate backend since it has a backend component with it to handle api calls.

Furthermore I chose to use Typescript to have some typed consistency with my code while also having the freedom that JS provides and is needed for the web.

I used Material UI as a UI library for development purposes.

I used Auth0 to handle authentication and used it to configure verification emails and user roles as well.


For this application, you have to wait a bit for the render deployment and the images to load, but then you can click on the listings to see the complete details.

You can only see the owner information if you're logged in.

The information displayed for each item depends on which fields are actually stored for that object, showcasing the noSQL nature of MongoDB and not having a fixed schema
